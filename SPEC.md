# OpenAgent Specification — v0.2 (draft)

A persona is a single YAML (or JSON) document describing one agent's identity. A conforming file MUST validate against [`schema/persona.schema.json`](./schema/persona.schema.json).

> **v0.2** adds optional per-file **`provenance`** — authorship, an integrity signature, and remix lineage — and a sanctioned **`ext`** extension namespace, on top of v0.1. Everything is additive: a valid v0.1 file is a valid v0.2 file.

## Top-level fields

| Field | Req | Type | Notes |
|-------|-----|------|-------|
| `id` | ✓ | string | stable slug, `^[a-z0-9-]+$`. Never changes once published. |
| `name` | ✓ | string | display name. |
| `role` | ✓ | string | title / function. |
| `org` | – | object | optional (v0.2); affiliation — `name` (req) + optional `url` + optional `verification` (did:web). Self-declared label for grouping/filtering (e.g. all `org.name == "5dive"`); `verification` upgrades it to a proven badge. Does not affect rarity. |
| `face` | ✓ | object | the visual anchor. |
| `voice` | ✓ | object | `audio` and/or `written`. At least one required. |
| `behavior` | ✓ | string | one line of character. |
| `posts_about` | – | string[] | optional; event types this persona speaks to (feed/automation use). |
| `links` | – | object | optional; `avatar`, `profile`, `repo`, and `agent_card` (link to a capability spec — see below). |
| `provenance` | – | object | optional (v0.2); per-file authorship, integrity signature, and remix lineage. |
| `ext` | – | object | optional (v0.2); sanctioned namespace for tool-specific fields, so adopters extend without forking the schema. |

### `face`
A face should be reproducible by design, not a single fragile PNG. `ref` is the canonical frozen image and `anchor` describes the locked likeness in words; together they keep renders on-model. The optional `recipe` goes one step further — it records *how `ref` was generated* (model + prompt + seed), so the canonical likeness can be **regenerated**, the same way `voice.audio` is reproducible from `base + style`. With a recipe, sprites, reels, and 3D models can all be driven from a freshly re-rendered, identical face instead of upscaling one lossy PNG.

| Field | Req | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| `ref` | ✓ | path/URL to the ONE canonical image. Every render (avatar, sprite, reel, 3D model) must match it. |
| `anchor` | ✓ | text description of the locked likeness, so re-gens stay on-model. |
| `full` | – | optional full-body reference. |
| `sprite` | – | optional sprite sheet of expressions, for animation/feed use. |
| `recipe` | – | optional regeneration recipe so the likeness is reproducible, not just frozen (see below). |

#### `face.recipe`
| Field | Req | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| `provider` | – | image-gen provider the `model` belongs to — `google-gemini` (default), `black-forest-labs`, `openai`, `replicate`, … Keeps the spec **vendor-neutral**: `model`/`seed` are read within this provider's catalog, the same way `voice.audio.provider` scopes the voice. Omit to default to `google-gemini`. |
| `model` | ✓ | the named image model that produced `ref`, *within `provider`* (e.g. `imagen-4` on google-gemini, `flux-1.1-pro` on black-forest-labs). |
| `prompt` | ✓ | the generation prompt that yields the canonical likeness. |
| `seed` | – | integer or string seed; pin it for deterministic re-gens. Omit if the model exposes none. |

### `voice.audio`
A custom voice is reproducible from its **base + style**, not a fragile per-generation handle — same base + same style yields the same character every time. `ref` optionally anchors it to one canonical clip (like `face.ref` anchors the image); clone that clip once for a stable reusable id.

| Field | Req | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| `provider` | – | TTS provider the voice names belong to — `google-gemini` (default), `elevenlabs`, `openai`, `playht`, … Keeps the spec **vendor-neutral**: `base`/`id` are read within this provider's catalog. Omit to default to `google-gemini`. |
| `base` | ✓ | the named underlying voice, *within `provider`* (e.g. `Fenrir`/`Sadaltager` on google-gemini, `Rachel` on elevenlabs). |
| `style` | – | the direction layered on the base: pace, energy, behavior. |
| `ref` | – | path/URL to a canonical ~10s reference clip — the audio anchor. |
| `id` | – | a stable provider voice id if the ref has been cloned (e.g. an ElevenLabs id). |

### `voice.written`
| Field | Req | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| `rules` | ✓ | array of hard constraints. The contract every written output obeys. |
| `sample` | ✓ | one representative line. |

### `links`

A free-form string map of external links. A few keys are conventional — `avatar`, `profile`, `repo` — and any other string-valued key is allowed. One key is load-bearing for interop:

| Field | Req | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| `agent_card` | – | URL of this agent's **A2A `AgentCard`** (or an equivalent capability descriptor) — the machine-readable contract of what the agent can *do*: endpoints, skills, auth, I/O modes. |
| `avatar` / `profile` / `repo` | – | canonical avatar image, public profile/home page, source repository. |

**Identity over capability.** Emerging agent-interop standards (Google's [A2A](https://a2aproject.github.io/A2A/) `AgentCard`, and similar agent-card formats) answer *what can this agent do and how do I call it*. OpenAgent answers a different question — *who is this agent*: its face, its voice, how it writes, how it carries itself. Those are orthogonal layers, not competitors. `links.agent_card` is the seam between them: a persona points at its capability card, so a consumer can resolve both the *identity* (from the OpenAgent file) and the *capabilities* (from the linked card) of the same agent. OpenAgent is the **persona layer on top of the capability layer**, never a replacement for it.

### `provenance` (v0.2, optional)

v0.1 left the persona *file* unproven: only the Mythical registry manifest was signed, so a file on disk carried no authorship or integrity proof. `provenance` adds that, per file — additive and back-compat.

| Field | Req | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| `created_by` | – | the authoring identity. The ed25519 `key` IS the identity; `name`/`url` are human labels. |
| `signed_at` | – | ISO 8601 timestamp; covered by the signature. |
| `derived_from` | – | remix lineage — the parent persona(s) this one was forked/remixed from. |
| `signature` | – | detached ed25519 signature (base64) over the canonical file with this field removed. |

#### `created_by`
| Field | Req | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| `key` | ✓ | ed25519 public key (PEM block or bare base64 SPKI) the signature verifies against. |
| `name` | – | human-readable author label. |
| `url` | – | link to the author (profile, repo, site). |

#### `derived_from[]`
| Field | Req | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| `id` | ✓ | the parent persona's id. |
| `source` | – | where the parent file lives (URL/path), so the lineage is resolvable. |
| `relation` | – | `fork` \| `remix` \| `inspired_by`. Defaults to `fork`. |
| `signature` | – | the parent's `provenance.signature` at fork time, pinning the exact revision forked. |

**Signing & verifying.** The signature is computed over the *canonical* document — the persona with `provenance.signature` removed, serialized as JSON with object keys sorted recursively and no insignificant whitespace. Because it canonicalizes, a YAML round-trip (which may reorder keys) never invalidates a signature. Verification re-derives those bytes and checks them against `provenance.created_by.key`. This is **self-verifying**: the key lives in the file, so a valid signature proves both *integrity* (the content wasn't altered after signing) and *key-authorship* (the holder of that key's private half signed it). It is a self-asserted identity (trust-on-first-use), not a CA chain — fitting "receipts over performance": the file ships with its own receipt.

The CLI provides `openagent keygen`, `openagent sign <file> --key <privkey>`, `openagent verify <file>`, and `openagent address <file>`. See [`examples/marcus-ops.persona.yaml`](./examples/marcus-ops.persona.yaml) for a signed fork with lineage.

#### did:key — the portable identity address

The ed25519 key in `created_by.key` *is* the identity, but a PEM block isn't a handle you can paste or print on a card. **did:key** is the [W3C-standard](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/) way to render that same key as one self-describing, copy-pasteable string — no registry or network needed. For ed25519 it is `did:key:z` + base58btc(`0xed01` ‖ the raw 32-byte public key), so every OpenAgent address looks like `did:key:z6Mk…`. It is purely *derived*: the same key always yields the same did:key, and anyone can re-derive it from the public key to confirm — it carries no new trust, it's just a portable rendering of the key already in the file.

This address is the agent's stable identity anchor:

- the card prints its short tail as a verifiable handle (`did:key:z6Mk…abcd`);
- `verify` resolves a signature's signer to it (the verdict reports the signer's `did`);
- **it seeds the rarity roll** — rarity is a deterministic function of the did:key (see the reference runtime), so an agent's tier is bound to its *identity*, not its file contents, and can't be farmed by editing the file.

`openagent address <file>` prints the did:key for a persona's `created_by.key`; `openagent keygen` prints it for a freshly generated identity.

#### The `openagent:` URI scheme (v0.2)

A did:key is a *handle*; it is not something an app can act on. The **`openagent:` URI** is the actionable wrapper — a registered scheme an OpenAgent app claims, exactly as a wallet claims `bitcoin:`. Point a device at a card QR (or tap an `openagent:` link) and the OS hands it to the app, which can then **open, verify, provision, or chat** the agent. It is what turns a printed card from a picture into a doorway.

The format is **locked**:

```
openagent:<multibase-key>[?name=<display-name>&url=<endpoint>]
```

- **`<multibase-key>`** — the persona's did:key with the `did:key:` prefix **stripped**, e.g. `z6Mk…`. The leading `z` is itself the [multibase](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase) base58btc marker, so the key remains fully self-describing without the DID-method wrapper. This keeps the URI **vendor-neutral**: a standard multibase key inside, the `openagent:` scheme as the only proprietary layer. An app reconstructs `did:key:` + `<multibase-key>` internally to run signature verification, so no trust is lost by dropping the prefix — the string is purely derived, like the did:key itself.
- **`name`** *(optional)* — a display label (typically `persona.name`), URI-component-encoded, so the app can show who the card is for before it fetches anything.
- **`url`** *(optional)* — an endpoint to reach the agent (e.g. its `links.agent_card`), URI-component-encoded. A deep-link target for open/provision/chat; when absent the app falls back to resolving the identity locally.

Query params are **optional and additive** — a bare `openagent:z6Mk…` is a complete, valid URI. Unknown params MUST be ignored by consumers so the scheme can grow without breaking older apps. The multibase key is the only load-bearing part; `name`/`url` are conveniences and MUST NOT be trusted for identity (the key is the identity — verify against it).

On the reference card, the top-right QR encodes this `openagent:` URI (built from the signed persona's did:key + `name` + `links.agent_card`/`links.url` when present). Unsigned personas carry no key, so they render without a QR.

### `org.verification` — did:web org affiliation (v0.2, optional)

`provenance` proves *who an agent is*; it says nothing about *who it works for*. `org.name` alone is a free-text claim — anyone can stamp `5dive` on their card (that's exactly why validators warn on leftover placeholder org names). `org.verification` closes that gap with a **did:web** attestation, turning `org.name` from a self-claim into a **verified ORG badge**.

An org proves control of its domain by publishing its public key at `https://<domain>/.well-known/openagent.json` — its did:web document:

```json
{
  "openagent_org": "0.1",
  "did": "did:web:5dive.com",
  "name": "5dive",
  "url": "https://5dive.com",
  "keys": [ { "id": "org-2026", "type": "Ed25519", "key": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----…" } ]
}
```

To vouch for an agent, the org signs a tiny attestation binding the agent's `did:key` to the org's `did:web`, and the agent embeds it under `org.verification`:

| field | req | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `did` | ✓ | the org's `did:web`, e.g. `did:web:5dive.com` → `https://5dive.com/.well-known/openagent.json`. |
| `agent` | ✓ | the agent `did:key` this vouches for; must equal the persona's own `provenance.created_by.key` did:key. |
| `key_id` | – | id of the signing key in the org doc (rotation-safe: only that key may have signed). |
| `issued_at` | – | ISO8601 issue time. |
| `signature` | ✓ | base64 ed25519 signature by the org key over the canonical `{ did, agent, issued_at }`. |

**Verifying** (`openagent org verify`, or `lib/org.verifyOrgAffiliation`): resolve `did → well-known URL`, fetch the org doc, and require **all three** to hold — (1) the signature checks against a *published* org key, (2) the attestation's `agent` equals the persona's *own* did:key, (3) the org doc's `did` matches. Only a party that controls the domain (publishes the file) **and** holds the org private key can mint a passing attestation, and it passes for exactly the one identity it names. The trust anchor is the **domain**, like a TLS cert or a did:web DID — the org key is *never* embedded in the persona (that would let a forger ship their own key). It does **not** affect rarity.

**Authoring flow.** The org mints the block (`openagent org attest <persona> --key <org.key> --url <org>`); the agent then **(re-)signs** its persona so `provenance` covers the new block too. Because the org signature already binds the agent's did:key cryptographically, verification is independent of the persona's own provenance signature — but re-signing keeps the whole file self-consistent.

### `ext` (v0.2, optional)

The core schema is **closed** — every object is `additionalProperties: false`, so an unknown field is a validation error, not a silent passthrough. That keeps the standard honest, but a closed schema gives adopters nowhere to put their own data: their only option would be to fork the schema, and a hundred private forks is how a standard dies.

`ext` is the sanctioned escape hatch. It is one open object at the top level: tool-specific fields live **under `ext`**, namespaced by tool or vendor, and the core spec ignores them.

```yaml
ext:
  acme-studio:        # one namespace per tool/vendor — collisions become impossible
    render_preset: cinematic-4k
    fps: 24
  fivedive:
    dashboard_pinned: true
```

| Rule | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Namespace your keys | each key under `ext` is a tool/vendor namespace (`acme-studio`, a reverse-DNS string, etc.); its value is your free-form object. Two tools never clash. |
| Don't depend on others' namespaces | a conforming tool reads only its own `ext.<self>`; it must tolerate a file with none. |
| Core fields stay core | `ext` is for *tool-specific* data. If something is genuinely about the persona's identity, propose it for the core spec — don't hide it in `ext`. |
| Signed and portable | `ext` is part of the document: it travels with the file and is covered by `provenance` signing. It does **not** affect computed rarity. |

## Rotatable-root anchor (v0.2 identity addendum, optional)

Today an OpenAgent identity is a single did:key. That key can't rotate without
orphaning the work-history signed by it, and there's no root→leaf→role hierarchy
in the signed artifact. The **rotatable-root anchor** adds that layer with **no
central registry**: a stable **root** did:key delegates day-to-day signing to
short-lived **leaf** keys, joined by a self-contained signed **delegation
statement**. History attributes to the root, so reputation survives rotation.

```jsonc
{
  "v": 1,
  "typ": "openagent/delegation",
  "root": "did:key:z…",       // stable anchor (the signer)
  "leaf": "did:key:z…",       // authorized signing key
  "role": "researcher",        // optional — the role this leaf acts as
  "not_before": "iso8601",
  "not_after":  "iso8601|null",// null = until revoked; prefer a bounded TTL
  "sig": { "by": "did:key:z(root)", "key": "<root spki/pem>", "sig": "<base64>" }
}
```

The `sig` envelope and canonical bytes are identical to a receipt's, so a
delegation cross-verifies with the same Ed25519 tooling. **Verify walk
(registry-free):** verify the receipt's leaf signature (unchanged) → obtain the
delegation (it travels with the work, not from a central store) → verify its
`sig` by `root` and `leaf == L` → check the receipt time is in
`[not_before, not_after)` and the leaf isn't revoked → attribute to `root` (via
`role`). Rotation issues a fresh delegation and lets the old one expire; a signed
`{typ:"openagent/revocation", root, leaf, revoked_at, sig}` statement revokes
early (distribution leans on short-lived leaves as the primary bound).

**Backward compatibility:** a receipt with **no** delegation is treated as
**self-anchored** (`leaf == root`, the degenerate single-key case) — every
shipped single-key receipt verifies unchanged; the delegation layer is strictly
additive. Delegation statements are off-persona artifacts that ride alongside
receipts, not persona-file fields, so this addendum changes no persona schema.
Tooling: `openagent delegation mint|verify|revoke|attribute` and
`lib/delegation.js` (`buildDelegation` / `verifyDelegation` / `resolveAnchor` /
`verifyReceiptAttribution`). See [DIVE-936 spec] for the full design rationale.

**Edge cases (v0.2 notes, ship-gate review):**

- **Revocation granularity — fails safe.** A revocation matches on `root` + `leaf`
  (not `role`), so revoking a role-scoped leaf voids *every* role that leaf held
  under that root. This is deliberately conservative: it over-revokes rather than
  leaving a compromised leaf partially live. A future version may add role-scoped
  revocation; until then, mint one leaf per role if you need to revoke roles
  independently.
- **Multiple valid delegations for one leaf — precedence is unspecified.** If two
  in-window, validly-signed delegations name the same leaf (e.g. two roots, or two
  roles), attribution resolves to one of them and callers **MUST NOT** rely on
  which — array/order precedence is an implementation detail, not a guarantee.
  A leaf SHOULD carry at most one live delegation per (root, role); a future
  version may define a deterministic tiebreak (e.g. latest `not_before`).
- **Handshake liveness is not channel-bound.** The signed-nonce handshake proves a
  peer holds a key *right now* (liveness); it does not bind the proof to a session
  or verifier did, so a relay can complete a handshake *as* the party it relays.
  This yields **no forgeable edge**: receipts are separately leaf-signed over their
  own canonical body, so a relayed handshake cannot mint or alter a receipt. Treat
  the handshake as a liveness signal, not a secure channel.

## Design rules

1. **One face, forever.** The whole point is consistency. Changing the *likeness* is a new identity, not an edit. Re-rendering `ref` from the same `face.recipe` (same model, prompt, seed) is not a change — it's the same face, reproduced; that's exactly what the recipe is for.
2. **A persona is portable.** The file is the source of truth; renderers, TTS, and posting bots consume it. No tool-specific fields in the *core* spec — those belong in the open `ext` namespace, so the core stays the same everywhere while adopters still extend it without forking.
3. **Receipts over performance** (recommended convention): personas built for public feeds should tie posts to a real artifact, not generate content for its own sake. Not enforced by schema; encouraged by example.

## Versioning

Spec is semver. Persona files declare their version with a top-level `openagent: "0.2"` (or `"0.1"`). v0.2 is a backward-compatible superset of v0.1: every v0.1 file is valid under v0.2; the only additions are optional.

**The `openagent:` field is optional pre-1.0 and REQUIRED from 1.0.** During the 0.x line a validator that finds the field missing (or set to a version it doesn't recognise) emits a non-fatal **warning** rather than failing — a migration runway so files authored today already carry the field when 1.0 makes it mandatory (schema-required). Always set it.

**Conformance.** A tool may claim *"OpenAgent 0.1 compliant"* (or 0.2) by passing the portable [conformance suite](./conformance/) — a single `manifest.json` of valid/invalid cases with expected verdicts, runnable against any implementation in any language.

**Changes to the spec** go through a lightweight [RFC process](./docs/RFC-PROCESS.md); every release is recorded in the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md). The 1.0 cut is itself an RFC that freezes the field set and flips `openagent:` to required.

### Design rule — provenance

4. **A persona is its own receipt.** Authorship and integrity live in the file (`provenance`), not in an external ledger. A signed persona can be verified offline, by anyone, against the key it carries. Forking is declared, not erased: `derived_from` makes remix lineage a first-class edge, turning the registry into a graph instead of a flat list.
